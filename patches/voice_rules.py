"""Pipeline-invariant system rules injected at request-assembly time.

Probed regression: qwen3.6 in no-think mode collapses answer length as chat
history grows (27 completion tokens for a 400-word ask, vs 415 with a
system-prompt line telling it to answer completely). The mitigation must
live at the pipeline layer, not as a runtime persona edit -- a persona
author has no way to know they need to include an anti-truncation
instruction, and every persona (and every brain swap) would otherwise need
to carry it individually.

:func:`apply_system_rules` appends (or inserts) a short system-level
instruction into the serialised message list right before it goes out on
the wire, independent of whatever persona/instructions the user configured.
It runs *after* the persona's own system message is built, so it augments
rather than replaces persona instructions.

Dependency-free by design (stdlib only, no ``speech_to_speech`` import),
like ``think_filter.py`` -- importable and unit-testable standalone.
