"""Wakeword join-deaf gate (ShayneP-borrow, see
knowledge-base/research-notes/shaynep-local-voice-ai-2026-07-12.md).

While armed, the pipeline stays deaf: incoming mic audio is scored against a
cheap openWakeWord ONNX model instead of being pushed onto ``input_queue``.
Only once the wake phrase is detected does audio start flowing to VAD/ASR.
Deploy-safe: disabled unless ``VOICE_WAKE_WORD=1`` (see
``websocket_streamer.WebSocketStreamer``), so a plain restart leaves
behaviour unchanged.

Design:

* **Lazy, dependency-free import.** ``openwakeword`` is only imported inside
  :meth:`WakewordGate._load_model`, on first use -- this module (and its
  tests) can be imported with neither ``speech_to_speech`` nor
  ``openwakeword`` installed.
* **Fail open.** Any exception while loading the model or scoring a frame is
  logged once and treated as an immediate, permanent wake for the rest of
  the session -- a broken detector must never brick the assistant.
* **Calibration affordance.** Any score above 0.05 is logged at DEBUG so the
  threshold can be tuned against a real microphone. A score at or above 0.25
  that doesn't cross the (higher) detection threshold is also logged at INFO
  as a near miss -- visible at the live log level, unlike the DEBUG line, so
  a real attempt that fell short leaves journal evidence.
* **Arbitrary frame boundaries.** ``feed()`` accumulates raw bytes into an
  internal buffer and only scores complete 1280-sample (80ms) frames --
  WebSocket frames arrive as multiples of 512 samples, not 1280, so a
  remainder must survive across calls.
* **Cross-thread safe.** ``feed()`` runs on the audio-loop thread while
  ``rearm()``/``set_model()``/``reset()`` can run on a control-message
  thread (``BrainControl.handle`` via ``asyncio.to_thread``) or on
  streamer-disconnect. All four share ``_lock`` around their mutable-state
  bodies; ``state()``, ``phrase``, ``available_models()``, and the
  ``awake``/``enabled`` reads stay lock-free (plain attribute reads, GIL-atomic).
